## The Group Scheduler App

Have you and a group of friends never been able to meet up because nobody seems to have any time available? Well I have, that's why I'm making this app.
Here, the final version of this app intends for you and your group of friends to be able to add your events in the form of tabs to a calender-like scheduler, representing the time they aren't available, making the empty space the times where you all can meet up.

As of now, there are no features allowing multiple users to share a schedule at once, so the current app is only a simple showcase of how the app would look when only one person would use a schedule at a time.
Below is a link to a demo video of the features that have been implemented so far:
